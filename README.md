[Table S6](S6.csv) shows the main effects in the HF register and 2 trials. 

coef: coefficients; sbp: systolic blood pressure; eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate; Diabetes and Male are categorical variables; others (with *) are all numerical variables and scaled by dividing by the standard deviation (SD) after subtracting the mean (both SD and mean referring to the HF register); AFT: accelerated failure time ratio with 95% confidence interval; --: Not available; composite outcome in COMET is all-cause death or all-cause hospitalisation, in DIG is death or hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure. 

[Table S8](S8.csv) shows the contribution of each covariate to the results differ between uncalibrated and regression-based method.

--: Not available; SBP: systolic blood pressure; eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate; Diabetes and Male are categorical variables, others are all numerical variables and scaled by dividing by the standard deviation (SD) after subtracting the mean (both SD and mean referring to the trial); the means in this table are the standardised mean; * multiply

[Table S11](S11.csv) shows the baseline profiles of lowest and highest risk deciles.

Categorical variables are shown as counts (%s) and continuous variables as means (standard deviations); --: Not available; eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate.

[Table S12](S12.csv) shows the calibrated results for overall, lowest and highest risk subgroup individuals.

IOSW: Inverse Odds of Sampling Weights; ARR: Absolute Risk Reduction; OR: Odds Ratio; Some are not OR, eg, Hazard Ratio for uncalibrated COMET, Risk Ratio for uncalibrated DIG; arm1 vs arm2: carvedilol vs metoprolol in COMET, digoxin vs placebo in DIG.
