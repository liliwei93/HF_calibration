[Table S6](S6.csv) shows the main effects in the HF register and 2 trials. 

coef: coefficients; sbp: systolic blood pressure; eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate; Diabetes and Male are categorical variables; others (with *) are all numerical variables and scaled by dividing by the standard deviation (SD) after subtracting the mean (both SD and mean referring to the HF register); AFT: accelerated failure time ratio with 95% confidence interval; --: Not available; composite outcome in COMET is all-cause death or all-cause hospitalisation, in DIG is death or hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure. 

[Table S7](S7.csv) shows the treatment interactions in 2 trials.

--: Not available; Diabetes and Male are categorical variables, others are all numerical variables and scaled by dividing by the standard deviation (SD) after subtracting the mean (both SD and mean referring to the HF register); composite outcome in COMET is all-cause death or all-cause hospitalisation, in DIG is death or hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure. 

[Table S10](S10.csv) shows the measure of effects in uncalibrated and calibrated analyses.

IPSW: inverse propensity score weighting; ARR: absolute risk reduction; OR: odds ratio; Some are not OR, eg, HR for uncalibrated COMET, Risk ratio for uncalibrated DIG; arm1 vs arm2: carvedilol vs metoprolol in COMET, digoxin vs placebo in DIG; death: all-cause death; composite outcome in COMET is all-cause death or all-cause hospitalisation, in DIG is death or hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure. 

[Table S11](S11.csv) shows the baseline profiles of lowest and highest risk deciles.

Categorical variables are shown as counts (%s) and continuous variables as means (standard deviations); --: Not available; eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate.

[Table S12](S12.csv) shows the calibrated results for overall, lowest and highest risk deciles individuals in the HF Register and trials.

IPSW: inverse propensity score weighting; ARR: absolute risk reduction; OR: odds ratio; Some are not OR, eg, HR for uncalibrated COMET, Risk ratio for uncalibrated DIG; arm1 vs arm2: carvedilol vs metoprolol in COMET, digoxin vs placebo in DIG; death: all-cause death; composite outcome in COMET is all-cause death or all-cause hospitalisation, in DIG is death or hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure; The number of low probability not included in IPSW is less than 1% in each trial, specifically, 22 (0.73%) for overall COMET,  1 (0.01%) for overall DIG, 2(0.07%), 0 (0%), 2 (0.03%), 1 (0.01%) for low risk decile COMET all-cause death, COMET all-cause death or hospitalisation, DIG all-cause death and DIG death or hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure respectively; 1 (0.03%), 8 (0.26%),  0 (0%), 0 (0%) for high risk decile for COMET all-cause death, COMET all-cause death or hospitalisation, DIG all-cause death and DIG death or hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure respectively.
